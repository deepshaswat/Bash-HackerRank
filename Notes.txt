Arithmetic operations:

echo `expr $a + $b`
echo `expr $a - $b`
echo `expr $a \* $b`
echo `expr $a / $b`

Comparing numbers:
read a
read b

  echo "X is equal to Y";
elif [ "$a" -gt "$b" ];then
  echo "X is greater than Y";
else
    echo "X is less than Y";

-eq # equal
-ne # not equal
-lt # less than
-le # less than or equal
-gt # greater than
-ge # greater than or equal


String comparison using == or !=
read a

if [ "$a" == "y" ] || [ "$a" == "Y" ];then
  echo "YES";
elif [ "$a" == "n" ] || [ "$a" == "N" ];then
  echo "NO";
